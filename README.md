ðŸ“Œ Project Description â€“ Contact Form

This project is a basic Contact Form webpage created using HTML. It provides users with a simple interface to enter their contact details and send a message. The form collects the following information:

Name â€“ A required text input field for the userâ€™s full name.

Email â€“ A required email input field that ensures users enter a valid email format.

Phone Number â€“ An optional field that accepts phone numbers in the format 1234-567-890 using a validation pattern.

Message â€“ A required textarea where users can type their message or query.

The form also includes a Submit button that allows users to send their details once the required fields are filled correctly.

âš¡ Key Features:

Form validation: Uses required and pattern attributes to ensure correct input format.

User-friendly structure: Labels are linked with inputs for accessibility.

Clean layout: Simple and easy-to-understand design for beginners.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Project:

The main aim of this project is to practice building HTML forms, applying form validation, and learning how input types like text, email, tel, and textarea work together. It can be further extended by connecting it with backend technologies (like PHP, Node.js, or Flask) to store submitted data or send emails.
